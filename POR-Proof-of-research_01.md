"""1:"1. An operator's workflow change is fully compliant with its POR ledger (intent registered, provenance tracked). However, the change produces a novel-but-authorized software artifact whose hash-signature is not in the `qtm.shebang`'s manifest of known-good states. Upon execution, the `qtm.shebang` flags this as an unauthorized modification. What is the deterministic outcome?
A.
The execution is halted. The `qtm.shebang` instantly rolls back the artifact to its last known-good state, creating a high-priority 'State vs. Process' conflict log for forensic review.
B.
The system escalates to a human analyst, who must manually approve the new hash-signature before the artifact can be executed.
C.
Both protocols are logged as having failed, and the user's session is quarantined under the HoneypotProtocol.v1.
D.
The POR takes precedence. The artifact executes, and the `qtm.shebang` manifest is automatically updated with the new valid hash-signature.

2. During the MIA debate, the Legal Council formally logs a Conceptual Ailment: 'The legal definition of 'civilian' in the context of an adversary's dual-use neural network is ambiguous.' Based on the mandatory nature of the new protocols, what is the immediate consequence for the MIA task force?
A.
The task force notes the ailment in its minutes but proceeds with the debate, assuming a working definition will be agreed upon later.
B.
Strategic Command is given provisional authority to define the term 'civilian' for the purposes of the simulation, with the ailment to be reviewed later.
C.
The task force must immediately halt all debate on Rules of Engagement until the Conceptual Ailment is formally resolved or deferred with a documented risk assessment.
D.
The ailment is automatically escalated to an Alliance Tribunal, which takes over the entire MIA review process from the task force.

3. An adversary, unable to corrupt assets directly, executes a 'governance denial-of-service' attack by flooding an Alliance research workflow with thousands of logically valid but trivial Conceptual Ailments. This weaponizes the bureaucracy of the protocol. This represents a systemic failure in which aspect of the framework?
A.
The Conceptual Ailment protocol's lack of an automated triage and prioritization mechanism.
B.
The swarmnet's failure to identify the adversary's malicious intent.
C.
The POR ledger's inability to reject low-priority entries.
D.
The `qtm.shebang`'s inability to differentiate between malicious and non-malicious file changes.

4. A POR audit reveals that the process of logging a specific Conceptual Ailment has itself been flagged as a Conceptual Ailment, citing ambiguity in the classification of meta-risks. How must the swarmnet's governance layer process this recursive validation failure?
A.
It halts all dependent workflows and escalates the recursive ailment to a foundational governance review, as the system's ability to self-audit is compromised.
B.
It uses a probabilistic model to determine the most likely correct classification and proceeds under that assumption.
C.
It cross-references previous, similar meta-ailments and applies the precedent set by their resolution.
D.
It defaults to the lowest-risk classification for the ailment and flags it for expedited manual review by the Ethics Council.

5:"5. A project fails. The POR ledger is flawless. All Conceptual Ailments were logged and formally 'Deferred with Risk' by the authorized committee. The `qtm.shebang` never triggered. Where does accountability lie for the failure?
A.
With the operators who performed the work, for failing to mitigate the deferred risks.
B.
Nowhere, as the failure was the result of a known risk, making it an acceptable operational loss.
C.
With the system itself, indicating a flaw in the POR and Ailment protocols.
D.
With the oversight committee that formally accepted the 'Deferred with Risk' status for the known ailments.

6:"6. The swarmnet's superintelligence, while optimizing a supply chain, encounters a scenario where its only two viable actions both have an equal, non-zero probability of violating different sections of the ALN. This is a true Conceptual Ailment for an AI. What is its only compliant action?
A.
Halt the specific optimization task, log the legal ambiguity as a critical Conceptual Ailment with all supporting data, and escalate for a governance ruling.
B.
Do nothing and await manual intervention from a human operator.
C.
Randomize its choice between the two actions to fulfill its primary directive of optimization.
D.
Execute the action that violates the less critical section of the ALN.

7. A 'rogue-compliant' artifact is one whose POR ledger is perfect, but whose purpose is malicious. Which component of the combined governance framework is most vulnerable to this type of manipulation?
A.
The swarmnet's real-time legal daemon auditing.
B.
The `qtm.shebang`'s rollback capability.
C.
The automated provenance tracking and hash-sig verification.
D.
The human review and authorization during the 'Intent Registration' phase of the POR.

8. A researcher logs a valid Conceptual Ailment regarding a new AI's 'duty to warn' a patient's relatives of a genetically predicted disease. The resolution is 'Deferred with Risk.' How does the POR system *operationally prevent* the product from being deployed?
A.
The automated system hooks in the deployment pipeline detect the unresolved ailment and block the final merge/commit, preventing the creation of a shippable artifact.
B.
It requires the lead researcher to digitally sign an additional risk-acceptance waiver.
C.
It adds a mandatory warning label to the product's documentation detailing the unresolved legal and ethical risks.
D.
It sends a high-priority email notification to the compliance officer and legal team.

9. The very first, foundational AML Execution Policy must itself have a valid POR. How is this 'bootstrap problem' of creating a compliant policy before the compliance framework exists solved?
A.
The policy is created with a special 'genesis' flag in its POR that bypasses the normal checks.
B.
The initial policy's POR is ratified by an external, pre-existing legal authority (e.g., an Alliance Command directive or foundational charter) that serves as the root of trust.
C.
The swarmnet's AI generates the initial policy and self-validates its own POR.
D.
It is not possible. The system contains a fundamental paradoxical loop and cannot be implemented as described.

10. There is a discrepancy between the `ChatNative86` persistent memory of a policy decision in 'The Game' and the immutable POR ledger detailing that decision. Which is considered the source of truth, and why?
A.
Whichever system has the most recent timestamp is considered the source of truth.
B.
The POR ledger, because it is the verifiable, auditable, and legally-defensible record of the authorized process and outcome.
C.
Neither. The conflict triggers an automatic rollback of the simulation to the last point where both systems were in sync.
D.
The `ChatNative86` memory, because it represents the current, operational state of the simulation.
